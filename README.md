# Muziki

## Introduction
Muziki is more than just an offline Android audio media player axzppâ€”it's a passion project born out of a love for music and a desire to create something meaningful. As the sole developer behind Muziki, I embarked on this journey with the vision of crafting an app that not only provides users with a seamless music listening experience but also evolves to meet their ever-changing needs.

## Inspiration and Technical Challenges
The inspiration for Muziki came from my own frustration with existing music player apps that lacked certain features or were too cluttered with unnecessary functionalities. I set out to create a simple yet powerful solution that prioritizes user experience above all else.

One of the technical challenges I faced was implementing an auto-generation playlist algorithm based on beats per minute (BPMs). While I initially planned to include this feature in the current version of Muziki, I encountered obstacles that prevented its realization. However, I'm excited to announce that this is a top priority for the upcoming updates. Stay tuned for an enhanced music discovery experience powered by BPM-driven playlists!
